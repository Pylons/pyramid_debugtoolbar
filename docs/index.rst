pyramid_debugtoolbar
====================

Overview
--------

:mod:`pyramid_debugtoolbar` provides a debug toolbar useful while you're
developing a :term:`Pyramid` application.

:mod:`pyramid_debugtoolbar` is a blatant rip-off of Michael van Tellingen's
``flask-debugtoolbar`` (which itself was derived from Rob Hudson's
``django-debugtoolbar``).  It also includes a lightly sanded down version of
the Werkzeug debugger code by Armin Ronacher and team.

.. warning:: This package only works with Pyramid 1.2a1 and better.

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools, e.g. (within a virtualenv)::

  $ easy_install pyramid_debugtoolbar

Setup
-----

Once :mod:`pyramid_debugtoolbar` is installed, you must use the
``config.include`` mechanism to include it into your Pyramid project's
configuration.  In your Pyramid project's ``__init__.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   config = Configurator(.....)
   config.include('pyramid_debugtoolbar')

Alternately, instead of using the Configurator's ``include`` method, you can
activate Pyramid by changing your application's ``.ini`` file, use the
following line:

.. code-block:: ini

   pyramid.includes = pyramid_debugtoolbar

.. warning:: The debug toolbar should never be enabled in a production
   environment or on a machine with its Pyramid HTTP port exposed directly to
   the internet; it allows arbitrary code execution from only semi-trusted
   sources when configured poorly.

Once the application is restarted, whenever an HTML response is generated by
Pyramid, it will include the debug toolbar as a floating element on right
hand side of the page.  Additionally, if f the configuration setting
``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` (the default), when an exception
is raised by your application, a "pretty" traceback will be
shown with inline debugging controls that will allow you to evaluate
arbitrary Python expressions within the traceback page.  A URL leading to a
debugging page for each exception raised by your application will
additionally be logged to the console.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Settings can be used to control the operation of the toolbar. These settings 
are typically specified in the Pyramid "app" section of the Pyramid ``.ini``
file.

``debugtoolbar.hosts``

   If the request's REMOTE_ADDR is not in this list, the toolbar will not be
   displayed and the exception handler will not be active.  Default:
   ['127.0.0.1', '::1'].  This should be a list or, if defined in a Paste ini
   file, a single-line list of IP addresses separated by spaces.

``debugtoolbar.enabled``

   ``true`` if the toolbar is enabled; ``false`` if the toolbar is disabled.
   Default: ``true``.  This disables both the exception handler and the
   toolbar overlay.

``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc``

   This setting can have one of three values: ``display``, ``debug`` or
   ``false``.  Default: ``debug``.  If this value is ``display``, the toolbar
   will display a "pretty" traceback page which allows source viewing and
   when an exception happens.  If this value is ``debug``, the "pretty"
   traceback page will be shown, but it will also contain interactive
   debugging controls which allow you to evaluate arbitrary Python
   expressions in the context of a portion of the traceback, which is useful
   when attempting to track down the cause of the exception. If this value is
   ``false``, the "pretty" traceback will be disabled and all exceptions will
   be raised to the caller of the Pyramid application (usually a WSGI
   server).  Default: ``debug``.  This setting differs from
   ``debugtoolbar.enabled``: it only enables or disables the exception
   handler.  Note that, for backwards compatibility purposes, the value
   ``true`` provided to this setting is interpreted as ``debug``.

``debugtoolbar.eval_exc``

   ``true`` if real-time exception debugging is enabled when
   ``intercept_exc`` is true; ``false`` if real-time exception debugging is
   disabled.  Default: ``true``.  This differs from
   ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc``: it only controls whether the pretty
   exception rendering displays real-time in-browser debugging controls.  The
   real-time in-browser debugging controls allow you to evaluate arbitrary
   Python expresssions in the context of a stack frame via a browser control.

``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects``

   ``true`` if the redirection handler is enabled; ``false`` if the handler
   is disabled.  Default: ``false``.  This differs from
   ``debugtoolbar.enabled``: it only enables or disables the redirection
   handler.

``debugtoolbar.panels``

    A list of dotted Python global names to panel classes.  Defaults to a
    list of all panel types known by :mod:`pyramid_debugtoolbar`, as
    documented in :ref:`pyramid_debugtoolbar_api`.  If this is spelled in an
    ``.ini`` file, it should be a space- or newline-separated sequence of
    dotted Python names.  For example::

      debugtoolbar.panels = 
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.versions.VersionDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.settings.SettingsDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.headers.HeaderDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.request_vars.RequestVarsDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.renderings.RenderingsDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.logger.LoggingPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.performance.PerformanceDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.routes.RoutesDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.sqla.SQLADebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.tweens.TweensDebugPanel
          pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.introspection.IntrospectionDebugPanel

``debugtoolbar.button_style``

    Any inline css styles you want to apply to the toolbar button. This
    will override the default style (top:30px) set by ``toolbar.css``. If,
    for example, you want the toolbar button to show up at the bottom off the
    screen, just set ``debugtoolbar.button_style`` to 'top:auto;bottom:30px;'.
    If you're browser support the zoom property, you can even control the
    magnification level of the toolbar button (ie. 'zoom:50%').

The Toolbar
-----------

When you include the toolbar in your application, a floating toolbar logo
will appear over your application's HTML:

.. image:: toolbar-closed.png

If you click on the "Pyramid DT" logo, the toolbar will expand:

.. image:: toolbar-open.png

Toolbar Panels
--------------

These are the default toolbar panels:

Versions
~~~~~~~~

Displays versions of all installed Python software as well as the Python
version and platform itself.

.. image:: versions.png

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Displays Pyramid deployment settings (aka ``registry.settings``).

.. image:: settings.png

HTTP Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays HTTP request and response headers for the current page.

.. image:: headers.png

Request Vars
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays objects attached to the request of the current page and the WSGI
environment.

.. image:: requestvars.png

Renderings
~~~~~~~~~~

Displays the renderings performed by Pyramid for the current page.

.. image:: renderings.png

Logging
~~~~~~~

Displays messages logged by the current page.

.. image:: logging.png

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays timing information, and, if enabled, Python profiling information
for the current page.  When the checkbox on the performance panel is green,
the request will be profiled and profiling information will be gathered and
displayed on the panel output.  When it is red, only timing will be done and
no profiling information will be captured.

.. image:: performance.png

Routes
~~~~~~

Displays the routes currently configured in your application.

.. image:: routes.png

Tweens
~~~~~~

Displays the tween chain for your application, and whether they were defined
explicitly or implicitly. 

.. image:: tweens.png

SQLAlchemy
~~~~~~~~~~

Displays SQL queries made by SQLAlchemy by the current page along with timing
information.

.. image:: sqla.png

Introspection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays a rendering of the data available in Pyramid's configuration
introspection system (available in Pyramid 1.3+ only).

.. image:: introspection.png

Exception Handling
------------------

When an exception is raised and the ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is
``display`` or ``debug``, Pyramid presents a pretty traceback page.  If the
setting value is ``debug``, you will be able to examine locals in each frame
in the traceback and execute code in the context of each frame.  Read the
instructions on the exception page for more information.

.. image:: exc.png

Redirect Handling
-----------------

When a response is returned to Pyramid that has a redirect status code (301,
302, etc) and the ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirect`` setting is ``true``,
Pyramid presents an interim page with a link to the target of the redirect.
You can use the toolbar on the redirect source page, then when finished, use
the link to continue to the target page.

Adding custom panels
--------------------

In some cases it can be desirable to add a custom panel to the toolbar to
display some application specific data. There are two steps for adding such a
panel to an application: writing the panel and adding it to your application
settings.

Writing the panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The panel can be created as part of your application or as a standalone
package. The easiest way to write a panel is to subclass from the
``pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.DebugPanel`` class. Here is the code for a
sample panel:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels import DebugPanel

    _ = lambda x: x

    class SampleDebugPanel(DebugPanel):
        """
        Sample debug panel
        """
        name = 'Sample'
        has_content = True

        def nav_title(self):
            return _('Sample')

        def url(self):
            return ''

        def title(self):
            return _('Sample')

        def content(self):
            vars = {'somelist':['sample value', 'another value']}
            return self.render(
                'samplepanel:templates/sample.mako',
                vars, self.request)

    def includeme(config):
        config.registry.settings['debugtoolbar.panels'].append(SampleDebugPanel)
        if not 'mako.directories' in config.registry.settings:
            config.registry.settings['mako.directories'] = []

After inheriting from the DebugPanel class, you have to define a few methods on
your panel:

``nav_title``

    Returns a function that can be called to get the title to be used on the
    toolbar's navigation bar for this panel.

``url``

    This is not used at the moment, but it has to be provided because the base
    class will raise NotImplemented if it's not there.

``title``

    Returns a function that can be called to get the title to be used on the
    panel's display page.

``content``

    Returns the panel's content for display. It can return an HTML response
    directly, but normally it's better to use a template, like in the example.

Once you define the panel it has to be added to the ``debugtoolbar.panels``
setting of the configuration. A good way to do this is to use an ``includeme``
method in the panel's ``__init__.py``.

Configuring an application to use the panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once your panel is ready, you can simply add its package name to the
``pyramid.includes`` setting on your application configuration file::

    pyramid.includes = pyramid_debugtoolbar samplepanel
