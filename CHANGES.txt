1.0.2 (2012-04-19)
------------------

- Moved the toolbar and debugger javascript files to use requirejs for
  better dependency loading and module isolation to play better with mutiple
  library versions. Recurrent problem was with async loading and application 
  specific jquery library where the expected version was overrided by the
  toolbar one.

  If you are already using requirejs and want the toolbar to load, just add it
  to your path and module::

    require.config({
      paths: {
        "jquery": "jquery-1.7.2.min",
        "toolbar": "/_debug_toolbar/static/js/toolbar"
      }
    });
    
    require(["jquery", "toolbar"], function($, toolbar) {
      $(function() {
        // your module
      });
    }); 

1.0.1 (2012-03-27)
------------------

- If ``request.remote_addr`` is ``None``, disable the toolbar.

1.0 (2012-03-17)
----------------

- Don't URL-quote SQL parameters on SQLAlchemy panel.

- Allow hostmask values as ``debugtoolbar.hosts`` entries
  (e.g. ``192.168.1.0/24``).

0.9.9.1 (2012-02-22)
--------------------

- When used with Pyramid 1.3a9+, views, routes, and other registrations made
  by ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` itself will not show up in the introspectables
  panel.

0.9.9 (2012-02-19)
------------------

- Try to take advantage of MakoRendererFactoryHelper in Pyramid 1.3a8+.  If
  we can do this, the toolbar templates won't be effected by normal mako
  settings.  The most visible change is that toolbar mako templates now have
  a ``dbtmako`` extension.

0.9.8 (2012-01-09)
------------------

- Show request headers instead of mistakenly showing environ values in
  Headers panel under "Request Headers".  This also fixes a potential
  UnicodeDecodeError.

- Set content_length on response object when we regenerate app_iter while
  replacing original content.

0.9.7 (2011-12-09)
------------------

- The performance panel of the debugtoolbar used a variable named
  ``function_calls`` which was not initialised when stats are not
  collected. This caused a ``NameError`` when mako rendered the template with
  the ``strict_undefined`` option.

- Fix Python 3 compatibility in SQLAlchemy panel.

- Make SQLAlchemy explain and select work again.

0.9.6 (2011-12-09)
------------------

- Added "Introspection" panel; active only under Pyramid 1.3dev+ (requires
  Pyramid introspection subsystem).

- Address heisenbug reported where performance panel template variables cause
  unexpected results.  Can't repeat, but reporter indicates the fix works for
  him, so hail marying.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/commit/5719c97ea2a3a41fc01e261403d0167cc38f3b49

0.9.5 (2011-11-12)
------------------

- Adjust tox setup to test older Pyramid and WebOb branches under 2.5.

- Convert all templates to Mako.

- Don't rely on ``pyramid.compat.json``.

- Add Tweens toolbar panel.

0.9.4 (2011-09-28)
------------------

- Upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and tablesorter plugin 2.0.5b

- Introduced new setting ``debugtoolbar.button_style``. Which can be used
  to override the default style (top:30px) set by ``toolbar.css``.

- Compatible with Python 3.2 (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).

- Appease settings values that were sensitive to ``__getattr__`` in the
  settings debug panel (e.g. MongoDB databases).  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/30

0.9.3 (2011-09-12)
------------------

- All debug toolbar panels and underlying views are now always executable by
  entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default permission that may be
  in effect (use the ``NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`` permission for all
  debugtoolbar views).

- Toolbar cookie settings name changed (from fldt to p_dt), to avoid messing
  up folks who use both the flask debugtoolbar and Pyramid's.

- Fix IE7 and IE8 renderings of the toolbar.

0.9.2 (2011-09-05)
------------------

- Log an exception body to the debug toolbar logger when an exception
  happens.

- Don't reset the root logger level to NOTSET in the logging panel (changes
  console logging output to sanity again).

0.9.1 (2011-08-30)
------------------

- The ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is now a tri-state setting.  It
  can be one of ``debug``, ``display`` or ``false``.  ``debug`` means show
  the pretty traceback page with debugging controls.  ``display`` means show
  the pretty traceback package but omit the debugging controls.  ``false``
  means don't show the pretty traceback page.  For backwards compatibility
  purposes, ``true`` means ``debug``.

- A URL is now logged to the console for each exception when
  ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` or ``display``.  This URL leads
  to a rendering of the "pretty" traceback page for an exception.  This is
  useful when the exception was caused by an AJAX or non-human-driven
  request.  This URL is also injected into the pretty traceback page (at the
  bottom).

- "Unfixed" indentation of SQL EXPLAIN done in 0.9, it broke the explain page
  when a column value isn't a string.

0.9 (2011-08-29)
----------------

- Fixed indentation of SQL EXPLAIN by replacing spaces with HTML spaces.

- ``response.charset`` in some undefined user-reported cases may be ``None``,
  which would lead to an exception when attempting to render the debug
  toolbar.  In such cases we now assume the charset is UTF-8.

- Some renderings of the request vars and renderer values would raise an
  uncaught exception.

0.8 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Try to cope with braindead Debian Python installs which package the
  ``pstats`` module separately from Python for god only knows what reason.
  Turn the performance panel off in this case instead of crashing.

0.7 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Docs-only changes.

0.6 (2011-08-21)
----------------

- Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
  with future 1.2 release).

0.5 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
  module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12

0.4 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
  ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
  application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.

0.3 (2011-08-15)
----------------

- Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
  circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).

- Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.

- Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
  "1.1.1dev".

- Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
  ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.

- Fix memory leak.

- HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.

- Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.

0.2 (2011-08-07)
----------------

- Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
  panel next to each query shown in the page).

- Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).

- Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.

0.1 (2011-07-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
