3.0.1 (2016-05-20)
------------------

- Avoid touching ``request.unauthenticated_userid``,
  ``request.authenticated_userid`` and ``request.effective_principals`` unless
  they are accessed by the user in the normal request lifecycle. This avoids
  some issues where unauthenticated requests could trigger side effects on
  your authentication policy or access the properties outside of the
  expected lifecycle of the properties.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/263

3.0 (2016-04-23)
----------------

- The toolbar is now a completely standalone application running inside the
  tween. There are several minor incompatibilities and improvements related
  to this extra isolation:

  1. ``pyramid_mako`` and the ``.dbtmako`` renderer are no longer included
     in the parent application (your app).
  2. Panels must be extra careful now that they only render templates inside
     of the ``render_vars`` and ``render_content`` functions. These are the
     only functions in which the ``request`` object is for rendering the
     toolbar panel.
  3. The toolbar will not be affected by any global security policies your
     application may put in place other than via
     ``config.set_debugtoolbar_request_authorization``.
     **never run the toolbar in production**

  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/253

- Updated Bootstrap to v3.3.6, refactored static assets and dropped require.js.
  Each page now depends on what it needs without extra dependencies included
  in the debugger pages.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/259

- Enabled interactive tablesorting on table columns.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/256

- setuptools-git is now required to install the codebase in non-editable mode.

2.5 (2016-04-20)
----------------

- Drop Python 2.6 and Python 3.2 support.

- Add Python 3.5 support.

- Remove inline javascript from injected pages to work better with any
  Content Security Policy that may be in place.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/250

- Added the packages' `.location` to the "Versions" panel so developers can tell
  which version of each package is actually being used.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/240

- Upon exception do a better job guessing the charset of the sourcefile when
  reading it in to display tracebacks.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/244

- Removed jQuery code in the toolbar referring to a DOM node called 'myTab',
  which doesn't seem to exist anymore.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/247

- Updated the "Request Vars" panel:
  1. Show additional values that were previously missing
  2. Sections upgraded to link to Pyramid Documentation when possible
  3. Mako reformatted into "defs" for simpler reorganization in the future
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/241

- Fix to prevent the toolbar from loading the session until it is actually
  accessed by the user. This avoids unnecessary parsing of the session object
  as well as waiting to parse it until later in the request which may meet
  more expectations of the session factory.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/249

2.4.2 (2015-10-28)
------------------

- Fix a long-standing bug in which log messages were not rendered until
  the end of the response. By this time the arguments passed to the logger
  may no longer be valid (such as SQLAlchemy managed objects) and you would
  see a ``DetachedInstanceError``.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/188

2.4.1 (2015-08-12)
------------------

- Remove the extra query hash constructed when indexing into SQL queries via
  url as it was unused after releasing 2.4.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/232

2.4 (2015-06-04)
----------------

This release changes some details of the panel API, so if you are writing
any custom panels for the toolbar please review the changes.

- Document the cookie used to activate panels on a per-request basis. It is
  possible to specify the cookie per-request to turn on certain panels. This
  is used by default in the browser, but may also be used on a per-request
  basis by curl or other http APIs.

- Add new ``debugtoolbar.active_panels`` setting which can specify certain
  panels to be always active.

- Modify ``DebugPanel.name`` to be a valid python identifier, used for
  settings and lookup.

- The toolbar no longer will clobber the ``request.id`` property. It now
  namespaces its usage as ``request.pdtb_id``, freeing up ``request.id``
  for applications.

- Add a lock icon next to the request method in the sidebar if the request
  was accessed over https.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/213

- Update to bootstrap 3.1.1.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/213

- Fix display of POST variables where the same key is used multiple times.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/210

- Fix auth callback so it protects the toolbar views. Auth system is tested
  now. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/226

- Convert SQLAlchemy views to obtain the query and params internally; this
  allows executing queries with parameters that are not serializable.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/227

- Adds Pyramid version tests and bumps required Pyramid version to 1.4.
  The pyramid_mako dependency requires 1.3, but debugtoolbar also uses
  ``invoke_subrequest`` which was added in 1.4. The ``invoke_subrequest`` call
  was added
  in pyramid_debugtoolbar 2.0; if you need Pyramid 1.3 compatibility, try
  an older version.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/183
  and https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/225

2.3 (2015-01-05)
----------------

- Support a ``debugtoolbar.includes`` setting which will allow addons to
  extend the toolbar's internal Pyramid application with custom logic.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/207

- Fixed an issue when the toolbar is not mounted at the root of the domain.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/201

- Fixed an issue where the `button_css` was not pulled from the settings.
  Added support for configurable `max_request_history` and
  `max_visible_requests`.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/206

2.2.2 (2014-11-09)
------------------

- Brownbagged 2.2.1, forgot to include the templates!

2.2.1 (2014-11-09)
------------------

- Several internal links were not relative causing them to fail when the
  app is mounted at a path prefix. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/185 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/196

- Pin pygments<2 on 3.2 as the new release has dropped support.

2.2 (2014-08-12)
----------------

- Avoid polluting user code with unnecessary toolbar css just to show the
  button. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/174

- Inject the toolbar button into ``application/xhtml+xml`` requests.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/176

- Make the toolbar accessible before another request has been served by the
  application. See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/171


2.1 (2014-05-22)
----------------

- Add new "debugtoolbar." configuration settings that allow enabling or
  disabling various Pyramid knobs in a users .ini file. This for instance
  allows easy enabling/disabling of template reloading for the debugtoolbar.

- Allow the toolbar to display always, even when the parent application
  is using a default permission.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/147

- Stabilize and document the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar.panels.DebugPanel``
  API to allow developers to create their own panels.

- Add new ``debugtoolbar.extra_panels`` and
  ``debugtoolbar.extra_global_panels`` configuration settings to make it
  simpler to support custom panels without overwriting the default panels.

2.0.2 (2014-02-13)
------------------

- Fix breaking bugs when run under Py3k.

2.0.1 (2014-02-12)
------------------

- Fixes a bug in 2.0 expecting pyramid_beaker to be around.

2.0 (2014-02-12)
----------------

- The toolbar has undergone a major refactoring to mitigate the effects of
  the toolbar's internal behavior on the application to which it is connected
  and make it possible to inspect arbitrary requests. It is now available at
  ``/_debug_toolbar`` and can be used to monitor any and all requests serviced
  by the Pyramid application that it is wrapping, including non-html responses.

  The toolbar will live-update (on conforming browsers via Server Sent Events)
  when requests come into the Pyramid application, and can be used to debug and
  inspect multiple requests simultaneously.

1.0.9 (2013-10-20)
------------------

- Use new ``pyramid_mako`` configuration directive add_mako_renderer.

1.0.8 (2013-09-09)
------------------

- Depend on ``pyramid_mako`` (Mako support will be split out of Pyramid in
  1.5+).

1.0.7 (2013-08-29)
------------------

- Drop support for Python 2.5.

- Fix computation of proxy addresses.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/100 .

- Make templates compatible with no-MarkupSafe Mako under Python 3.2.

- Decode platform name to Unicode using utf-8 encoding to cope with nonascii
  characters in platform (e.g. Fedora's Schrodinger's Cat).  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/pull/98

- Raise a ``pyramid.exceptions.URLDecodeError`` instead of a raw
  UnicodeDecodeError when the request path cannot be decoded.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/issues/1057.

- Added new configuration option: `debugtoolbar.show_on_exc_only` (
  default=false).  If set to true (`debugtoolbar.show_on_exc_only = true`)
  the debugtoolbar will only be injected into the response in case a
  exception is raised. If the response is processed without exception the
  returned html code is not changed at all.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/54

- Fix various UnicodeDecodeError exceptions.

1.0.6 (2013-04-17)
------------------

- Packaging release only, no code changes.  1.0.5 was a brownbag release due to
  missing directories in the tarball.

1.0.5 (2013-04-17)
------------------

- Parse IPs correctly when request.remote_addr is a comma separated list
  of proxies IPs.

- If you are also using require.js, the debug toolbar's version of jQuery
  will no longer conflict with your application's version of the library.

- Use the "n" filter to disable default_filters when including the raw
  SQL in links, leaving only the "u" filter (URL escaping).

- Support for per-request authorization of toolbar middleware via
  ``config.set_debugtoolbar_request_authorization(callback)`` where callback
  accepts request object and returns boolean value whether toolbar is enabled
  or not.

- Short term fix for preventing error when converting binary query params to json.

- Fix sqlalchemy query duration from microseconds to milliseconds.

1.0.4 (2013-01-05)
------------------

- Add a ``debugtoolbar.excluded_prefixes`` setting.  When a URL path prefix
  matches one of these prefixes, the toolbar will not be shown on the resulting
  page.

- Show the prompt and little text file icons show all the time, instead of
  only on hover.

- Do not set max-height on result boxes (which result in nested scroll on
  the page, which makes it hard to find information quickly).

- When an expression result is long, do not truncate with an ellipsis, which
  requires one more click to get at the information I need.

- Support ``pip install`` from the github repository by adding all static files
  required to install in the ``package_data`` ``setup.py``. Setuptools usually
  uses Subversion or CVS to tell it what static files it needs to package up
  for egg distribution, but does not support reading git metadata.

- The debug toolbar now use a patched version of require.js with a distinct
  private name that cannot clash with the dojo loader or other incompatible
  versions of require that may already be loaded on the page. You no longer
  need to add the toolbar to your own require.js to make it work.

1.0.3 (2012-09-23)
------------------

- The ``valid_host`` custom predicate used internally by pyramid_debugtoolbar
  views didn't use newer "ipaddr"-based logic.  Symptom: some views may have
  been incorrectly inaccessible if you used a network mask as a
  "debugtoolbar.hosts" option.

- The debug console now works with Google App Engine.

- The debug console now adds a shortcut for accessing the last result through
  ``_``.

1.0.2 (2012-04-19)
------------------

- Moved the toolbar and debugger javascript files to use requirejs for
  better dependency loading and module isolation to play better with mutiple
  library versions. Recurrent problem was with async loading and application
  specific jquery library where the expected version was overrided by the
  toolbar one.

  If you are already using requirejs and want the toolbar to load, just add it
  to your path and module::

    require.config({
      paths: {
        "jquery": "jquery-1.7.2.min",
        "toolbar": "/_debug_toolbar/static/js/toolbar"
      }
    });

    require(["jquery", "toolbar"], function($, toolbar) {
      $(function() {
        // your module
      });
    });

1.0.1 (2012-03-27)
------------------

- If ``request.remote_addr`` is ``None``, disable the toolbar.

1.0 (2012-03-17)
----------------

- Don't URL-quote SQL parameters on SQLAlchemy panel.

- Allow hostmask values as ``debugtoolbar.hosts`` entries
  (e.g. ``192.168.1.0/24``).

0.9.9.1 (2012-02-22)
--------------------

- When used with Pyramid 1.3a9+, views, routes, and other registrations made
  by ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` itself will not show up in the introspectables
  panel.

0.9.9 (2012-02-19)
------------------

- Try to take advantage of MakoRendererFactoryHelper in Pyramid 1.3a8+.  If
  we can do this, the toolbar templates won't be effected by normal mako
  settings.  The most visible change is that toolbar mako templates now have
  a ``dbtmako`` extension.

0.9.8 (2012-01-09)
------------------

- Show request headers instead of mistakenly showing environ values in
  Headers panel under "Request Headers".  This also fixes a potential
  UnicodeDecodeError.

- Set content_length on response object when we regenerate app_iter while
  replacing original content.

0.9.7 (2011-12-09)
------------------

- The performance panel of the debugtoolbar used a variable named
  ``function_calls`` which was not initialised when stats are not
  collected. This caused a ``NameError`` when mako rendered the template with
  the ``strict_undefined`` option.

- Fix Python 3 compatibility in SQLAlchemy panel.

- Make SQLAlchemy explain and select work again.

0.9.6 (2011-12-09)
------------------

- Added "Introspection" panel; active only under Pyramid 1.3dev+ (requires
  Pyramid introspection subsystem).

- Address heisenbug reported where performance panel template variables cause
  unexpected results.  Can't repeat, but reporter indicates the fix works for
  him, so hail marying.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/commit/5719c97ea2a3a41fc01e261403d0167cc38f3b49

0.9.5 (2011-11-12)
------------------

- Adjust tox setup to test older Pyramid and WebOb branches under 2.5.

- Convert all templates to Mako.

- Don't rely on ``pyramid.compat.json``.

- Add Tweens toolbar panel.

0.9.4 (2011-09-28)
------------------

- Upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and tablesorter plugin 2.0.5b

- Introduced new setting ``debugtoolbar.button_style``. Which can be used
  to override the default style (top:30px) set by ``toolbar.css``.

- Compatible with Python 3.2 (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).

- Appease settings values that were sensitive to ``__getattr__`` in the
  settings debug panel (e.g. MongoDB databases).  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/30

0.9.3 (2011-09-12)
------------------

- All debug toolbar panels and underlying views are now always executable by
  entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default permission that may be
  in effect (use the ``NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`` permission for all
  debugtoolbar views).

- Toolbar cookie settings name changed (from fldt to p_dt), to avoid messing
  up folks who use both the flask debugtoolbar and Pyramid's.

- Fix IE7 and IE8 renderings of the toolbar.

0.9.2 (2011-09-05)
------------------

- Log an exception body to the debug toolbar logger when an exception
  happens.

- Don't reset the root logger level to NOTSET in the logging panel (changes
  console logging output to sanity again).

0.9.1 (2011-08-30)
------------------

- The ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is now a tri-state setting.  It
  can be one of ``debug``, ``display`` or ``false``.  ``debug`` means show
  the pretty traceback page with debugging controls.  ``display`` means show
  the pretty traceback package but omit the debugging controls.  ``false``
  means don't show the pretty traceback page.  For backwards compatibility
  purposes, ``true`` means ``debug``.

- A URL is now logged to the console for each exception when
  ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` or ``display``.  This URL leads
  to a rendering of the "pretty" traceback page for an exception.  This is
  useful when the exception was caused by an AJAX or non-human-driven
  request.  This URL is also injected into the pretty traceback page (at the
  bottom).

- "Unfixed" indentation of SQL EXPLAIN done in 0.9, it broke the explain page
  when a column value isn't a string.

0.9 (2011-08-29)
----------------

- Fixed indentation of SQL EXPLAIN by replacing spaces with HTML spaces.

- ``response.charset`` in some undefined user-reported cases may be ``None``,
  which would lead to an exception when attempting to render the debug
  toolbar.  In such cases we now assume the charset is UTF-8.

- Some renderings of the request vars and renderer values would raise an
  uncaught exception.

0.8 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Try to cope with braindead Debian Python installs which package the
  ``pstats`` module separately from Python for god only knows what reason.
  Turn the performance panel off in this case instead of crashing.

0.7 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Docs-only changes.

0.6 (2011-08-21)
----------------

- Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
  with future 1.2 release).

0.5 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
  module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12

0.4 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
  ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
  application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.

0.3 (2011-08-15)
----------------

- Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
  circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).

- Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.

- Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
  "1.1.1dev".

- Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
  ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.

- Fix memory leak.

- HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.

- Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.

0.2 (2011-08-07)
----------------

- Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
  panel next to each query shown in the page).

- Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).

- Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.

0.1 (2011-07-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
