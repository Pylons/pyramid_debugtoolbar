0.9.8 (2012-01-09)
------------------

- Show request headers instead of mistakenly showing environ values in
  Headers panel under "Request Headers".  This also fixes a potential
  UnicodeDecodeError.

- Set content_length on response object when we regenerate app_iter while
  replacing original content.

0.9.7 (2011-12-09)
------------------

- The performance panel of the debugtoolbar used a variable named
  ``function_calls`` which was not initialised when stats are not
  collected. This caused a ``NameError`` when mako rendered the template with
  the ``strict_undefined`` option.

- Fix Python 3 compatibility in SQLAlchemy panel.

- Make SQLAlchemy explain and select work again.

0.9.6 (2011-12-09)
------------------

- Added "Introspection" panel; active only under Pyramid 1.3dev+ (requires
  Pyramid introspection subsystem).

- Address heisenbug reported where performance panel template variables cause
  unexpected results.  Can't repeat, but reporter indicates the fix works for
  him, so hail marying.  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/commit/5719c97ea2a3a41fc01e261403d0167cc38f3b49

0.9.5 (2011-11-12)
------------------

- Adjust tox setup to test older Pyramid and WebOb branches under 2.5.

- Convert all templates to Mako.

- Don't rely on ``pyramid.compat.json``.

- Add Tweens toolbar panel.

0.9.4 (2011-09-28)
------------------

- Upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and tablesorter plugin 2.0.5b

- Introduced new setting ``debugtoolbar.button_style``. Which can be used
  to override the default style (top:30px) set by ``toolbar.css``.

- Compatible with Python 3.2 (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).

- Appease settings values that were sensitive to ``__getattr__`` in the
  settings debug panel (e.g. MongoDB databases).  See
  https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/30

0.9.3 (2011-09-12)
------------------

- All debug toolbar panels and underlying views are now always executable by
  entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default permission that may be
  in effect (use the ``NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`` permission for all
  debugtoolbar views).

- Toolbar cookie settings name changed (from fldt to p_dt), to avoid messing
  up folks who use both the flask debugtoolbar and Pyramid's.

- Fix IE7 and IE8 renderings of the toolbar.

0.9.2 (2011-09-05)
------------------

- Log an exception body to the debug toolbar logger when an exception
  happens.

- Don't reset the root logger level to NOTSET in the logging panel (changes
  console logging output to sanity again).

0.9.1 (2011-08-30)
------------------

- The ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is now a tri-state setting.  It
  can be one of ``debug``, ``display`` or ``false``.  ``debug`` means show
  the pretty traceback page with debugging controls.  ``display`` means show
  the pretty traceback package but omit the debugging controls.  ``false``
  means don't show the pretty traceback page.  For backwards compatibility
  purposes, ``true`` means ``debug``.

- A URL is now logged to the console for each exception when
  ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` or ``display``.  This URL leads
  to a rendering of the "pretty" traceback page for an exception.  This is
  useful when the exception was caused by an AJAX or non-human-driven
  request.  This URL is also injected into the pretty traceback page (at the
  bottom).

- "Unfixed" indentation of SQL EXPLAIN done in 0.9, it broke the explain page
  when a column value isn't a string.

0.9 (2011-08-29)
----------------

- Fixed indentation of SQL EXPLAIN by replacing spaces with HTML spaces.

- ``response.charset`` in some undefined user-reported cases may be ``None``,
  which would lead to an exception when attempting to render the debug
  toolbar.  In such cases we now assume the charset is UTF-8.

- Some renderings of the request vars and renderer values would raise an
  uncaught exception.

0.8 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Try to cope with braindead Debian Python installs which package the
  ``pstats`` module separately from Python for god only knows what reason.
  Turn the performance panel off in this case instead of crashing.

0.7 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Docs-only changes.

0.6 (2011-08-21)
----------------

- Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
  with future 1.2 release).

0.5 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
  module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12

0.4 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
  ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
  application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.

0.3 (2011-08-15)
----------------

- Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
  circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).

- Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.

- Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
  "1.1.1dev".

- Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
  ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.

- Fix memory leak.

- HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.

- Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.

0.2 (2011-08-07)
----------------

- Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
  panel next to each query shown in the page).

- Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).

- Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.

0.1 (2011-07-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
