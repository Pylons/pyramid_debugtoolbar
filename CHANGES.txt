Next release
------------

- Upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and tablesorter plugin 2.0.5b

0.9.3 (2011-09-12)
------------------

- All debug toolbar panels and underlying views are now always executable by
  entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default permission that may be
  in effect (use the ``NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`` permission for all
  debugtoolbar views).

- Toolbar cookie settings name changed (from fldt to p_dt), to avoid messing
  up folks who use both the flask debugtoolbar and Pyramid's.

- Fix IE7 and IE8 renderings of the toolbar.

0.9.2 (2011-09-05)
------------------

- Log an exception body to the debug toolbar logger when an exception
  happens.

- Don't reset the root logger level to NOTSET in the logging panel (changes
  console logging output to sanity again).

0.9.1 (2011-08-30)
------------------

- The ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is now a tri-state setting.  It
  can be one of ``debug``, ``display`` or ``false``.  ``debug`` means show
  the pretty traceback page with debugging controls.  ``display`` means show
  the pretty traceback package but omit the debugging controls.  ``false``
  means don't show the pretty traceback page.  For backwards compatibility
  purposes, ``true`` means ``debug``.

- A URL is now logged to the console for each exception when
  ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` or ``display``.  This URL leads
  to a rendering of the "pretty" traceback page for an exception.  This is
  useful when the exception was caused by an AJAX or non-human-driven
  request.  This URL is also injected into the pretty traceback page (at the
  bottom).

- "Unfixed" indentation of SQL EXPLAIN done in 0.9, it broke the explain page
  when a column value isn't a string.

0.9 (2011-08-29)
----------------

- Fixed indentation of SQL EXPLAIN by replacing spaces with HTML spaces.

- ``response.charset`` in some undefined user-reported cases may be ``None``,
  which would lead to an exception when attempting to render the debug
  toolbar.  In such cases we now assume the charset is UTF-8.

- Some renderings of the request vars and renderer values would raise an
  uncaught exception.

0.8 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Try to cope with braindead Debian Python installs which package the
  ``pstats`` module separately from Python for god only knows what reason.
  Turn the performance panel off in this case instead of crashing.

0.7 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Docs-only changes.

0.6 (2011-08-21)
----------------

- Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
  with future 1.2 release).

0.5 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
  module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12

0.4 (2011-08-18)
----------------

- Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
  ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
  application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.

0.3 (2011-08-15)
----------------

- Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
  circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).

- Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.

- Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
  "1.1.1dev".

- Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
  ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.

- Fix memory leak.

- HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.

- Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.

0.2 (2011-08-07)
----------------

- Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
  panel next to each query shown in the page).

- Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).

- Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.

0.1 (2011-07-30)
----------------

- Initial release.
